# Welcome to the PoreSpy Examples Gallery

This repository contains a collection of examples illustrating the various uses of PoreSpy.  The repo is organized in the same manner as the code, with a folder for each module.  To find examples on the use of the various filters offered by PoreSpy, navigate to the ``filters`` folder.  The file names should be relatively descriptive of what they contain.
